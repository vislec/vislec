<h2 align="left"> Hello! My name is Vitoria Brito, I'm a programming student!</h2>

### 📚 get to know me

- 💻 **Self-taught back-end developer** passionate about problem-solving and building efficient, scalable systems. My journey into technology started early, but it took me time to realize that development was more than just a tool—it was something I truly enjoyed and wanted to master.

- ⚙️ **Tech Stack**: *Python*, *Java*, *JavaScript*, *Kotlin*, *HTML*, *CSS*.
- 🛠 **Tools & Environment**: *IntelliJ*, *VS Code*, *PyCharm*, *Linux*, *Windows*.

- 🌱 **Current Focus**: I'm deeply invested in improving my back-end skills, working with databases, APIs, and system architecture. While my main focus is back-end development, I'm also exploring front-end technologies to eventually grow into a ***full-stack developer***.

- 📌 **What Drives Me?** The process of turning ideas into functional applications fascinates me. I love optimizing code, solving complex problems, and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skill set.

- **Next Steps**: Expanding my portfolio with challenging projects, contributing to open-source, and refining my understanding of software architecture.
